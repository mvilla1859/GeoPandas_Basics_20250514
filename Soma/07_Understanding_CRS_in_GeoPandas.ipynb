    "- The **shape** of the Earth (ellipsoid)\n",
    "- The **position** of the model Earth (datum)\n",
    "- The **units** (e.g., degrees, meters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these define how coordinates (like latitude and longitude) are interpreted."

    "- 1980 and 1984 versions (increasingly accurate)\n",
